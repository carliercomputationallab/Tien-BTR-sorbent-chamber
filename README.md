Column adsorption study

The code aims at representing the simulation of adsorption process in the sorbent chamber and studying how to improve the efficacy in solute clearance 
rate. 

From the measured adsorption data, plotting the breakthrough curves and fitting different models (Thomas and Yoon-Nelson) to the breakthrough 
curves in order to determine the best-fit model that describes the adsorption behavior of the adsorbent in the sorbent chamber. Next, optimizing the 
adsorption process by varying the flow rate and mass of the adsorbent to examine which experimental conditions lead to the ideal adsorption rate.
